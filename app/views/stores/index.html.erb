             Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show.
             That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to
             the people who make shows, and on the strength of that
             one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
             Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some
             don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
             became nothing.
